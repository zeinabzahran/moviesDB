Hi,

*The top 2 icon buttons have no details about their functionality, therefor, the back arrow icon will either exit the application or exit the search box according to the situation.

*The 3 dots option icon has nothing to do.

*The search box located between the two icons works on 'enter' button on the keyboard, which is 'onSubmitted' programatically. In addiotn, there is no api url for fetching data sorted by name, so I did it locally by searching in the all top movies response.

*The type of the show -Tv series/ Movie- is included in the screenshot but not in the requirements of the first screen task, and it has no corresponding field in the json response, so I put it a statc text -Movie.

Thanks.
